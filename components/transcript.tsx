        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (00:00)
        <br /> Okay, so thank you for taking the time
        to do this interview. I'm going to record the conversation, and it will
        transcribe so I can use it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        To give you an introduction to my project&mdash;I'm doing a project on
        generative AI use in schools, how we implement it, and how that&rsquo;s
        going to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (00:36)
        <br /> Sounds great!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (00:38)
        <br /> Yeah, so let's get into the questions. You're Leah Lindblom, and
        you work here at Arvada West for Jeffco as a teacher and Technology coordinator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (00:56)
        <br /> So, yes, I'm Leah Lindblom, the technology coordinator here at
        Arvada West High School. That means I handle anything related to
        technology&mdash;fixing it, budgeting for it, sitting in on meetings,
        listening to everybody&rsquo;s needs, and training teachers on how to
        use tools, like generative AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (01:11)
        <br /> Yeah! And how long have you worked here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (01:14)
        <br /> Since 1996&mdash;a long time. I think 28 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (01:21)
        <br /> Yeah. So how did you get into this job? What was your pathway?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (01:27)
        <br /> Well, first, I was an Earth Science and Physics teacher, and one
        of my classes was in a tech lab. Each station had equipment, software,
        and different tasks to complete&mdash;it was super hard and challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I went and got a master&rsquo;s degree in how to integrate technology
        into the curriculum. The administration really liked that, so they asked
        me to teach teachers how to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (01:56)
        <br /> Got it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (01:58)
        <br /> And that&rsquo;s how I got on this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (02:01)
        <br /> Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (02:03)
        <br /> Getting my master&rsquo;s degree led to me training teachers.
        That turned into a part-time teaching role and part-time professional
        development role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the guy who was fixing all the computers worked out of the same
        office I was in. So I learned how to do his job. He encouraged me to go
        to Red Rocks and get certifications&mdash;the same kind I now encourage
        you guys to get. So I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when he retired, I took over all the tech and professional
        development. But I was doing everything alone, and it got really hard.
        So, I started having students help me. That turned into a
        class&mdash;basically teaching kids how to do my job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (02:44)
        <br /> Yeah, nice!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (02:47)
        <br /> So, in this role, do you need a lot of math skills?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (02:54)
        <br /> Not really, not a lot. It&rsquo;s a fundamental course, so we
        don&rsquo;t dive deep into things like IP addressing, or converting from
        hex to binary and back. A lot of that stuff, you can just look up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The math really comes in when you&rsquo;re taking computer science
        classes&mdash;like when you&rsquo;re coding in Python. But in my class,
        it&rsquo;s more of a broad introduction: basics of computers,
        networking, a bit of cybersecurity&mdash;a little bit of everything.
        It&rsquo;s more of a survey course.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (03:30)
        <br /> Yeah, okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (03:43)
        <br /> So let&rsquo;s get into questions specifically about AI. What do
        you personally think about using AI in schools?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (03:57)
        <br /> Back in the day, people freaked out when Google became a thing.
        &ldquo;Oh my gosh, kids can look up the answers!&rdquo; AI is just the
        next big change&mdash;it&rsquo;s disruptive, but really cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I do think the world at large needs to rein it in a little.
        It&rsquo;s exploding so fast that people can&rsquo;t keep up. We
        don&rsquo;t fully know if it&rsquo;s going to be bad or good. It could
        be the most amazing thing ever, and I hope it&rsquo;s used for good.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI contributes to our knowledge base by processing huge amounts of
        information and then presenting it in a way we can understand.
        That&rsquo;s exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (04:40)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (04:41)
        <br /> I&rsquo;m really excited about AI, and I think it should be used
        in schools. But it&rsquo;s moving too fast, and we haven&rsquo;t trained
        teachers properly on it. Some teachers love it, some completely reject
        it. Some are locking down their classrooms, while others see it as just
        another tool in the toolbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s like Google all over again&mdash;people wanted to ban
        computers because students could Google answers. Instead of banning AI,
        we need to adjust how we teach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (05:09)
        <br /> Yeah, I definitely agree.
      </p>
      <p>So, are you responsible for training other teachers on AI?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (05:17)
        <br /> Not solely. It&rsquo;s me, the instructional coach, and the
        digital teacher-librarian.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a team called ALT&mdash;I don&rsquo;t actually know what it
        stands for, which is kind of funny. But there are two groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>OLT</strong> handles the business side&mdash;budgeting, buying
          resources like computers or science equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ALT</strong> focuses on learning&mdash;how we implement new
          curriculum, district strategies, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s the group we start AI conversations with. They bring
        information to their departments, and when we have staff development
        days&mdash;when you guys have a day off&mdash;we train the whole staff
        on new tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (06:34)
        <br /> Yeah, I&rsquo;ve already seen some classes implementing AI.
      </p>
      <p>Would you say AI will have a net positive impact?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (06:49)
        <br /> Yes, definitely. But I also think there&rsquo;s a
        risk&mdash;especially with people using it for the wrong reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s what makes me nervous. Like, what are companies or bad
        actors doing with AI? It&rsquo;s like stem cell research&mdash;are we
        okay with growing babies in a lab? Should AI be controlled more?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (07:31)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (07:32)
        <br /> I&rsquo;d <em>like</em> to think AI will be a net positive. But
        if the wrong people with power use it for the wrong things, it could go
        very wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (07:44)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (07:47)
        <br /> Hopefully, the good guys will use it for good&mdash;and block the
        bad stuff. That&rsquo;s the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (07:54)
        <br /> I agree. So your biggest concern is the ethical side and how fast
        AI is advancing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (08:03)
        <br /> Yes, 100%. It&rsquo;s moving so fast, we can&rsquo;t keep up.
        Sometimes, students know more than I do because they have more time to
        play with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Younger people tend to be more curious and experimental, while adults
        slow down their learning over time. That&rsquo;s why I think students
        will outpace teachers on AI knowledge pretty quickly. But that&rsquo;s
        also powerful and cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (08:43)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (08:33)
        <br /> So I think that's where students are going to outpace our
        learning pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>But that&rsquo;s also powerful and cool.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (08:43)
        <br /> But&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (08:44)
        <br /> They&rsquo;ll still need us to babysit! <em>Just kidding.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (08:50)
        <br /> Yeah. Um, okay. So, I&rsquo;m guessing AI has already changed
        schools and teaching&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (09:02)
        <br /> Oh, quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (09:05)
        <br /> Yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (09:06)
        <br /> Our principal, Mr. Porter, uses AI a ton to present findings to
        us. He&rsquo;ll take a huge amount of data he&rsquo;s gathered, ask AI
        to analyze it, and get the top 10 key takeaways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use AI a lot too&mdash;to draft lesson plans, create slide decks,
        compose letters. But I still have to go in and edit everything;
        it&rsquo;s not perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have to do these things called <em>lesson internalization</em>
        &mdash;where you break a lesson down into what you're trying to teach,
        the end goals, and how it aligns with state, national, or Jeffco
        standards. That&rsquo;s a lot of work. AI helps by finding the relevant
        information, so now I can just bring that document to my team meeting
        and we refine it together instead of creating everything from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (10:15)
        <br /> Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (10:16)
        <br /> Now, we just bring it in and edit it live&mdash;it&rsquo;s so
        powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, for example, I can take a whole bunch of statistical data from my
        class and have AI analyze it. It might tell me, &ldquo;Whoa,
        you&rsquo;re asking bad questions,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a clear
        trend in your students' learning.&rdquo; It just saves so much time when
        we&rsquo;re having these discussions as a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (10:37)
        <br /> How do you think AI will continue changing schools in the next
        five or ten years?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (10:44)
        <br /> It&rsquo;s going to change things the way Google did. It&rsquo;s
        a disruption, but we&rsquo;ll adapt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shift will be toward teaching <strong>durable skills</strong>
        &mdash;things like communication, leadership, metacognition, critical
        thinking, collaboration, character, creativity, a growth mindset,
        mindfulness, and fortitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s what education is going to focus on: building well-rounded,
        critical thinkers who know how to use AI effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (11:32)
        <br /> And ask good questions of the AI. So, we&rsquo;re going to build
        character, and we&rsquo;re not necessarily going to be teaching the same
        way anymore. We don&rsquo;t have to be the textbook.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used to be the textbook for students&mdash;we had the knowledge. But
        now, knowledge is out there, and we have to teach kids how to find
        information, evaluate it, and critically analyze whether it&rsquo;s
        credible or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (12:00)
        <br /> Well, now&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (12:01)
        <br /> Now, you can have AI write your papers and create your art. So,
        we have to make sure students know how to use these tools
        well&mdash;ethically and creatively&mdash;and collaborate to see what
        they can build together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (12:16)
        <br /> Yeah. So, there&rsquo;s going to be more focus on&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (12:21)
        <br /> Teaching&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (12:22)
        <br /> A mindset, rather than just specific knowledge. And, like&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (12:26)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (12:31)
        <br /> These are the durable skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because that&rsquo;s really&mdash;it sums up what makes a quality
        worker. It&rsquo;s all in one piece of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (12:44)
        <br /> It&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (12:45)
        <br /> It doesn&rsquo;t say <em>what</em> you know, but if you embody
        those 10 things, you&rsquo;re probably going to be an amazing worker.
        Then, you can use your resources and tools&mdash;like AI&mdash;to
        maximize your goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (12:59)
        <br /> So, you think AI is probably going to change education even more
        than the internet did?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (13:05)
        <br /> Oh, for sure. Yeah, definitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll lose our jobs because of it&mdash;not at
        all. But it will completely change <em>how</em> we create good citizens
        and contributing members of society.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (13:30)
        <br /> Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (13:31)
        <br /> Now, we&rsquo;re starting to evaluate the <em>use</em> of
        AI&mdash;who is using it well? And it&rsquo;s amazing to see what
        creative things students are coming up with.
      </p>
      <p>Like when we had that chatbot project&mdash;were you in that?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (13:44)
        <br /> The Magic School? Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (13:47)
        <br /> Yeah! It was super cool as a teacher to watch how students
        interacted with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some students already knew how to write a good prompt, and some were
        completely lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (13:57)
        <br /> The student who can write the <em>best</em> prompt is going to be
        the one who gets the A, you know what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (14:04)
        <br /> Yeah, like&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (14:05)
        <br /> Nope, you&rsquo;re not there yet. Here&rsquo;s a rubric for
        prompt writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can <em>watch</em> your results live&mdash;it&rsquo;s like your own
        personal tutor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (14:15)
        <br /> Do you think there will be separate classes for prompt writing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (14:21)
        <br /> Oh, maybe. That&rsquo;d be kind of cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I think it&rsquo;ll be contextual&mdash;like if you&rsquo;re an
        English teacher, you&rsquo;ll teach prompt writing in the context of
        writing essays. If you&rsquo;re in a science class, you might use it to
        structure hypotheses or analyze data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my class, it&rsquo;s broad&mdash;you can really do anything you want
        in here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (14:42)
        <br /> And I&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (14:43)
        <br /> I do think certifications are really valuable. They prove that
        you understand the basics&mdash;without AI doing it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, let&rsquo;s be real, we all Google things once we get into the
        real world. I don&rsquo;t have to memorize specific vocabulary or how to
        convert hex to binary&mdash;I can just Google it or have AI do it.
      </p>
      <p>But you still need to prove you have that fundamental skill set.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (15:14)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (15:22)
        <br /> Alright, we&rsquo;re mostly done. I think I&rsquo;ll end with a
        few career-related questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        How important would you say mentoring and networking are in this field?
      </p>

        <br /> HUGE.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that&rsquo;s true for any career, honestly. People always say,{" "}
        <em>It&rsquo;s more about who you know than what you know.</em> And I
        think that&rsquo;s true.
      </p>
      <p>
        It goes right back to these durable skills. If you can shake
        someone&rsquo;s hand, make eye contact, show up on time&mdash;you can do{" "}
        <em>any</em> job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical thinking, metacognition&mdash;those are what matter in every
        field.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s why we have internships and job shadows. You don&rsquo;t
        really <em>know</em> a job until you experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (16:33)
        <br /> Yeah, okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in your case, what opportunities or people had the biggest impact on
        your career?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (16:45)
        <br /> Remember that first tech guy?
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, he was a huge influence. He let me learn alongside him.</p>
      <p>
        Some tech people are <em>super</em> protective of their
        knowledge&mdash;they just take the mouse and fix things themselves
        instead of teaching you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he was really good at stepping back and letting me do the work while
        he explained. That was huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And over time, it was also books I read, conferences I attended. I was
        big on ISTE&mdash;the International Society for Technology in Education.
        I used to go to that conference every year. It&rsquo;s a <em>huge</em>{" "}
        international tech conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was a big influence. So were publications and professional
        organizations&mdash;<strong>CompTIA</strong> is a big one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (17:45)
        <br /> Yeah, okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (17:48)
        <br /> And my colleague, Dan&mdash;he worked at a different school at
        first, but we&rsquo;d go to the same meetings, and I learned so much
        from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, when I was allowed to hire someone, I was like,{" "}
        <em>Dan, you should come over here!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (18:08)
        <br /> Yeah. Did any of your parents work in IT?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (18:17)
        <br /> Nope! It was just me walking through open doors, being curious,
        and wanting to solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw a problem in my classroom&mdash;it needed to be fixed. So, I went
        and got the knowledge to fix it. Then other people saw what I was doing
        and were like,{" "}
        <em>Wait, I want to solve problems too! Can you teach me?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I said, <em>Sure!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (18:47)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (18:49)
        <br /> But my parents were really cool. My dad was in the Air Force, and
        my mom was a yoga teacher. So I had this mix of military structure and
        yoga philosophy&mdash;it was a weird but cool balance.
      </p>
      <p>They were always very encouraging, kind, and supportive.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (19:07)
        <br /> Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (19:14)
        <br /> Okay, cool. I think that covers everything I wanted to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (19:21)
        <br /> One last thing&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if this is true for all
        teachers, but I learn a <em>lot</em> from my students.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (19:27)
        <br /> Yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (19:28)
        <br /> Oh yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t know half the things going on out there&mdash;I just open
        doors for you guys to explore your curiosities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking this certification is just proof that you understand the
        fundamentals of IT. But there&rsquo;s <em>so much</em> more to learn in
        the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally love cybersecurity, but not everyone does. I also love
        hardware and networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonathan</strong> (20:01)
        <br /> Nice, cool!
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leah Lindblom</strong> (20:02)
        <br /> You&rsquo;re welcome!
