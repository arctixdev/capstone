            Early in the morning on November 30th, 2022, a new chatbot was
            released to the internet by a small research non-profit by the name
            of OpenAI, this chatbot was of course what we now know as ChatGPT.
            In less than 5 days the website attracted more than a million active
            users, becoming the fastest growing website in the entire history of
            the internet. The majority of those users? Students.
            <br />
            <br />
            Personally I have always been interested in technology, and I
            remember following OpenAIs progress way before ChatGPT was released.
            One of the things that really got me interested in coding, was
            actually making a chatbot inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man when I
            was 10. From the moment I saw the first developer preview of
            ChatGPT, I knew that it was going to be groundbreaking in education,
            the thing I didnâ€™t realize back then tho? How incredibly quickly it
            would be distributed and improved.
            <br />
            <br />
            And this is exactly the problem, schools and teachers are having an
            incredibly hard time keeping up with the rapid development of AI.
            And this with a good reason, AI technologies are improving at insane
            speeds and are becoming available for free for everyone. We have
            never in the history of humankind had technology evolving so
            quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            My capstone project goes into how we can help schools to integrate
            AI into their curriculum. I want to figure out how K-12 schools can
            successfully implement AI in their classrooms in a way that
            effectively teaches AI literacy and utilization to allow students to
            be successful in a world with AI in its center, while still
            preserving students' creativity and authentic learning.
